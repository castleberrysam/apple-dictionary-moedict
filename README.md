## MOE Cross-Straits Dictionary (兩岸詞典) and Revised Dictionary (重編國語辭典修訂本) for Dictionary.app

These are user dictionaries for Dictionary.app that add the Taiwan MOE Cross-Straits and Revised CN-CN dictionaries. I find these dictionaries to be more complete/comprehensive than the CN-CN and CN-EN dictionaries already provided by Apple. By adding them to Dictionary.app they can be easily consulted while reading web articles and other media using macOS's tap-to-lookup feature.
